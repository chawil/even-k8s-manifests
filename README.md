# even-k8s-manifests

Even system manifests

## objectives

- have manifests you can kubectl apply on a fresh k3s instance
- have some helm to set up the useful stuff (certificate issuer, simple router like nginx, and more...)

## links

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/connecting-frontend-backend/
- https://k3d.io/ probably the fastest way to have a running kubernetes cluster up and running (k3s in docker)
